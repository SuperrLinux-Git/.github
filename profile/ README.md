# 👋 Welcome from the SuperrLinux Team

Hey, Linux world 🐧💻

We are the **SuperrLinux Team** — not just coders, but Linux-loving goofballs building things we actually enjoy using.

## 🧠 Who We Are

We're daily Linux users who got tired of bloated systems, slow tools, and restrictive setups.

We believe in simplicity, performance, and full control.  
This isn’t corporate Linux. This is **SuperrLinux** — made by us, maybe for you too.

— 💙 The SuperrLinux Team
